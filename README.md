# angular-secure-password
Secure implementation of password field. Stores password in a UInt8Array instead of string which can be wiped out securely. Uses key-presses as opposed to input fields.

Standalone code (assuming Angular setup) can be found at [this codepen](http://codepen.io/joshlongerbeam/pen/dGRNER/).
